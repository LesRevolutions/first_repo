This project is a side project aimed in depicting plots of OPS+ of all qualified hitters in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1960 to 2019. 

What is OPS?

OPS (On-Base Percentage Plus Slugging) is one of the batting stats used to measure how good a player is in reaching base (through a hit or a walk) and in hitting for power (the higher the slugging, the more often he gets doubles, triples, or home runs).


What is OPS+ then?

OPS+ is used to adjust OPS, where OPS+ of 100 is defined to be league average.
